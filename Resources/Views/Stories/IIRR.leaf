"My fellow Space Stationians. Thank you for joining me for my first inaugural State of the Station address. Thank you, yes, thank you. Thank you.
Today's is the most televised and, there's no other real way to say this, YUUUUUUGE State of the Station address. This is the most well attended, viewed, the biggest audience for a State of the Station address in history. Yes it is. Now there have been reports that this wasn't going to be the case. Yes, I know you've all heard them. Well I'm here to tell you these reports are fake news, fake news written by sad, sad people. Haters. Losers.
I'm here to talk to you about what we'll be looking forward to in the next year, but also to remind you of what an amazing success the first year of my Admiralcy has been. Over the last year, the galaxy has seen what we always knew: that no people out here are so fearless, or daring, or determined as us. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we grab it. Yes we do. Yes we do. We see opportunity and we grab it. So let's look at the opportunities we have grabbed in the past year. I looked at the Solar Plant and I thought â€˜You know what? OPPORTUNITY people. And what do we do when we see an opportunity? That's right, yes! We grab it. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great flag, why not take the infrastructure we all rely on and seize it in the name of opportunity? And that opportunity was to make the boring Solar Plant, with all those stupid shiny panels, and turn it into the largest tanning salon in the galaxy. It's important that we show everyone else here on the Lagrange Point that we are a strong people, we are a proud people and we are a healthy people, and everyone knows a deep tan is the best way to show off muscle and make your teeth look super good.
With the tremendous success of the tanning salon, I hear you asking what next? Well, I'm so glad you asked. Yes I am. Next up, I'm proud to announce that work has recently completed on adding premix cocktails into the water supply, and converting the Water Works into a water park that, I'm proud to announce, we are calling A Splash Of Freedom. Yes! Thank you, you're too kind. You love your station. And you deserve a Government that shows you the same love and loyalty in return.
Now, I'm going to spend the next three hours talking you through my plan to have a military parade in my honour. And, after that, there'll be time for some more questions about the wall.
