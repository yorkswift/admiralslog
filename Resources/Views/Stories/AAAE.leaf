What I Did On My Summer Holidays
By Billy, Age 6 and 3/4

My mum and dad are always saying how special I am, so this summer I got to go to a special summer camp for very special children. It was in space! None of my friends were going but mum said that's because they aren't as special as me and I would make new friends who were even better so I was not sad.
I was very excited to go to the special summer camp for very special children, but when I go there it was quite rubbish. There were lots and lots of kids there like me, I thinked there was too many kids in there. I thought we would be running around and playing football and catching frogs and watching cartoons, but all they did was put funny hats on us with all sorts of wires coming out and try to make us do things with our brains. I had to try and make a can of cola move without using my hands, I wasn't very good at it. The grown ups kept telling me not to get dissasstracted but I liked to watch the motorbikes out of the window. They went VROOOOOOOOOOM so fast they left funny lights where they had been. I wanted to go and look but they wouldn't let us.
There was one boy there who was really good at making the can move. He made it fly around the room, and then it hit one of the grown ups in the head! They said it was OK but everyone looked super mad, but they wouldn't get mad with the boy.
I tried my best to make friends with the boy, I shared my bestest crayons but he didn't like colouring, and he would not say what his name was. He kept saying we were in a prison, not a special summer camp for very special children. He kept asking why it said SPECIAL WEAPON RESEARCH on the door. All the grown ups looked really mad when he said that. They tried to make him sit down, but he made the grownups get away from him without using his hands. Then the door smashed. He went out into the corridor outside and there were more grown ups, different ones with guns. The boy looked at them and the whole corridor went CRASH like the cola cans did sometimes, only this time there was grown ups in it. We all left then.
Next year, I want to go to music camp. I hope I get a puppy for my birthday too.
