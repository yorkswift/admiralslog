Long haired, goatee wearing teenagers, trying to impress people with their philosophical nature, will tell you that the band The Doors got their name from Aldous Huxley's Mescaline fuelled essay The Doors of Perception. Generations of them have trotted this fact out moments before mangling Wonderwall on an acoustic guitar, which inevitably doesn't produce the desired effect of sparking a romantic encounter, but hasn't stopped them trying.
Mescaline, Huxley thought, could alter the perception of those who took it and awaken a truer, higher form of consciousness. Also, it made looking at old paintings and flowers super fun, an idea many people who've ever had to spend a day wandering around a garden centre or an art gallery under duress would find extremely appealing.
There isn't a huge amount to look at in space. The view is one of infinite majesty in its glorious, savage and bottomless black. Black with little white dots, yes, but black nonetheless. Just black, nothing much else. Black. Think about black. It's not even a colour, it just is. It's black. It's very goth, but not very interesting, when you get down to it.
So the Admiral decided to do something about that. Inspired by the pioneering/ridiculous research people like Huxley had undertaken, they sought to make this view more interesting to look at.
As a general rule of thumb, there are lots of things that can be done to make a view from a window more interesting. You could, for example, add a window box with some nice flowers in it. You could hang a lovely pair of curtains over it, or a Venetian blind if you fancy something modern and chic. Experimenting with psychoactive substances should not be very high on the list. The first concoction made everything day-glow colours, which didn't really do much for the blackness of space. It still looked just as black as before, no more, no less. The second attempt yielded a bizarre hallucinogenic that made everyone look like food items, something the Admiral decided was probably not a good idea after somebody told them they looked like a roast chicken. Further study brought about other strange side effects such as a mixture that made everything look like a Saturday morning cartoon, complete with skin tones the same as a well made cup of tea. Another made everything look like it was covered in brightly coloured paisley, which didn't solve the view problem but gave them all some great ideas for wallpaper.
Finally, they cracked it. By employing a melange of various esoteric spices sourced from an obscure desert world, they produced a synthetic agent that, while it didn't alter the way in which people perceived things, it did make them feel like whatever they were looking at was the most interesting thing ever created. Finally, they had accomplished their goal, the perfect drug, now they were finally free to spend all day staring out the windows like true champions of science.
