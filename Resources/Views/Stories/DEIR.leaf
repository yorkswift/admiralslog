Throughout history, ever since someone was daft enough to use it as an analogy for the human condition, people have struggled with the phrase "You can't have your cake and eat it." Cake is, in the context of this example, a metaphor for the wants and desires of the psyche weighed against the cost of attaining or satisfying them and the ever shifting boundaries of what defines them. In fact, one notable philosopher/poet of the twentieth century was heard to utter the line "No You Can't Always Get, What You Want&hellip;" Before swanning off and, to his credit, doing exactly what he wanted for quite a long time without any real sense of consequence. In fact that's probably a bad example. Anyway, the point is this: You can't have it all.
On balance, the Admiral had done an exceptional job with the design and implementation of their station. They had a functional military who kept them safe. They had a strong thirst for knowledge, which was satisfied by their excellent school system, producing keen minds ready for the rigours of station life among the stars. They were warm, comfortable and cared for by an efficient and modern maintenance department, and enjoyed all the recreational luxuries of the age, including transistor radios, jogging, fondues and colour television. Truly marvels, each of them.
Unfortunately, though they had so many wonderful things, they lacked one fundamental ingredient to a successful, harmonious station: They forgot to put in anywhere for people to sleep.
Now, their problems were very different. Having been born as a station where everything was in it's right and proper place, into this delicate equilibrium came a plague the likes of which no order bound system can survive:
Children.
Without clear and designated places to sleep, people began to improvise. Cots were rigged up under desks, in canteens, in nooks and service cupboards. Hammocks were strung up in ductwork, cushions were propped in doorways. Inginuity will only get you so far. 
Rates of pregnancy among the crew rocketed. It wasn't so much a Summer Of Love, as the stationary craft of the Lagrange Point experienced no seasons, however this only made things worse as the Summer Of Love should inevitably give way to the Autumn Of Responsibility And Thinking More Carefully About Things. For this crew, no such time arrived, and the birds and bees were left to run amok.
Population levels exploded. The headcount of the station tripled, then again, then again. Resources were stretched to breaking point, but on the station limped, a shadow of its former utilitarian self. 
The worst part though? Any traveller who was unlucky enough to hail them on video comms was bombarded with passive aggressive demands to look at photos of each crew members numerous children. Truly awful.
