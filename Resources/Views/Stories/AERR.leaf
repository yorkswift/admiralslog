There are advantages to living at a Lagrange Point. What could be more poetic, more beautiful, more gratifying to the soul than to hang unmoving amidst the very cosmos itself? Caught forever in a slow pirouette, destined to dance among the stars, always.
One of the downsides of course being that you have to be cool with spending a lot of time with the exact same group of people, day in and day out, every day. The same faces, the same configurations, the same voices and the same annoying little habits that at first you found endearing, but six years in make you want to fire someone out of an airlock for making the same "Crazy weather we're having, eh?" Joke they've bene making for the last two thousand, one hundred and ninety days. Also it's really hard to get a sun tan as you have to spend one hundred percent of your days, all day every day, indoors.
It's easy, under such conditions, to allow the mind to wander and try to come up with a solution. Left to their own devices, the crew began to dream of how to change the course of their lives, and in a fashion, life found a way. It's not like the crew of the station is going to change magically overnight, is it? Of course not, aside from the possibility of some shape shifting alien pathogen subsuming people and stealing their identities you're stuck with the people you've got, unless you can convince a lot of new people to come take a look around your station&hellip;
Tourism. That was the answer. But what to do to get people to visit?
The Admiral had to admit it was a pretty sweet idea. By combining lizard DNA with a few drops of food colouring and putting the whole thing in one of those Grow-Your-Own probiotic yoghurt makers they had effectively stumbled upon a way to clone actual, living dinosaurs. Or found the worst thing you could put on your muesli, but people wouldn't really pay to see that.
Unfortunately, the only snag to their plan was that it actually takes a really long time for a dinosaur to go from a little wriggly thing that's just come out of an egg to a full grown, terrifying, 4x4 overturning behemoth. They announced the grand opening of the newly christened Mesozoic Park when the first batch hatched, but when people came to see the terrifying kings of the lizards they found the tallest of them was about waist high. Not exactly big enough to install fear and awe in people, but actually people didn't seem to mind. In fact, quite the opposite: they liked them that way. People thought they were&hellip; cute.
Soon, visitor numbers began to increase. Unperturbed by the diminutive dinos, people crowded to the Lagrange Point to come and see these tiny terrors. The gift shop did a roaring trade in plush versions of people's favourite pygmy reptiles, and the station flourished. They may not have been the thirty foot tall monsters advertised, but these ones were safely housed, well cared for and at absolutely no risk of running amok should someone deactivate the electric fence.
Plus, you could ride them like little scaly bumper cars.
