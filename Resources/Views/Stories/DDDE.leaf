They called it The Strongroom. There were no windows. There was one door and one door only, a huge toothed thing that had rolled shut and never opened since, sealing them within. It was the only way, it was for their own safety.
Nobody questioned this. Nobody asked to go outside. They only knew one thing, that the Admiral's word was law, and that to break the law meant death.
They arose every day at the same time. The Strongroom's klaxon would sound, and everyone must be up, out of their bunk, washed and ready to go in five minutes. By ready to go, they of course meant heavily armed and ready to defend their freedom with their lives. These men, women and children of this sealed ark, safe in motionless space, awaiting the end. Each with the same shaved head, the same blue and yellow jumpsuit, the same expressionless face.
They had drills after this. Weapon drills where they would strip, oil, maintain, reassemble and fire a weapon blindfolded. Some of them had scars from where they had inserted the fuel canister wrong or accidentally put a hand over the Thermal Exhaust Port. Such injuries were common among them, but they learned quick not to make the same mistake twice, If it came to it, out there among the damned, such a failing would be fatal.
They had unarmed combat drills after this, learning how to disarm an opponent, strike a deadly blow using only their feet and fists. They learned how to clutch one fist in another and use it, club like, to thump first the solar plexus then the back to down an enemy, as they had seen in the old instructional cassettes of the toupee wearing man in the coloured uniform, striking aliens while blue women in miniskirts looked on longingly.
They ate, in-between these activities. The same food for every meal, always. A single glass of water and a small stack of green crackers. They tasted somewhat salty, a little of bacon, and nobody really knew what was in them or where the materials to make them came from. They had no contact with the outside world, after all.
The rest of the day was filled with more drills, before finally they all gathered to watch THE WARNING. The cabinet that housed THE WARNING was wheeled out and they all stood to attention, a rapt audience, as it was plugged in and THE WARNING came to life behind a glass screen on the front of the cabinet.
They knew what happened, of course, it was always the same. The tiny white avatar of The Strongroom at the bottom of the screen, above it in ever advancing lines the hordes of vile creatures that were coming for them as surely as tomorrow's lunch would be green crackers. THE WARNING taught them the same lesson every time, but the lesson was valuable, frightening, pulled no punches but showed them instead a glimpse of the terrible conflict that was coming. The enemy would advance in their ranks, confident in the superiority of their numbers, and they of The Strongroom would resist. They would fight back, and the conflict would intensify. Wave upon wave of the enemy would come for them, getting faster, more cunning, more desperate as they cut them down.
They had their sealed door, their green crackers, their arsenal and THE WARNING. When the future came for them, they would be ready for it.
