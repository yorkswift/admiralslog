Human beings are fragile, temporary things.
Alone among all the members of the animal kingdom, human beings are the only creature with the concept of a head cold. The only creature that would legitimately stop what it was doing and thus endanger it's own survival based on a stubbed toe. The only living thing that will deliberately take off it's protective outer layers when moving indoors because otherwise they won't feel the benefit.
The Admiral of the station in question had done something rather extreme. There were those who treated the Lagrange point as a kind of second renaissance, a place away from the noise and confusion of the overcrowded, cerebrally taxing lives they led before coming here. A place to study, connect with a deeper kind of learning.
Then, there were others still, who treated the Lagrange Point like a kind of International Waters, a place of lawlessness where anything goes, and it frequently did.
The Admiral sought to combine these two. Tired of the constant stream of sickness and excuses that they saw as crippling the productivity of the station, they implemented a new and shocking protocol.
The first person who stubbed their toe was immediately rushed to the sickbay of the station. There, the offending toe was removed and replaced with a robotic facsimile. Problem solved. Not only could they now perform as if the injury had never even happened, but it would never happen again.
Soon, other benefits became apparent with the introduction of more advanced technologies and refinements to the procedures. Engineers could have arms built that incorporated electric drills or welding torches. Soldiers had skin bonded with metal to create body armour. Cooks could have knife blade fingers to finely chop vegetables, or wrists that transformed into whisks to quickly knock up an omelette or a rum syllabub.
Truly, the only limit was their imagination, and their station became a focus of engineering and medical research for all Lagrange Points. Of course, everyone preferred to keep them confined to their own station as half robot people with DIY implements instead of limbs, while being technical marvels, are also incredibly creepy.
And so, theirs became an efficient but lonely existence, isolated by their Admiral's own genius and vision. Alone they would stalk the halls of their station, muttering to themselves, mad with boredom. Nothing but ghosts in the station's shell.
