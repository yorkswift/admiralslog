EXTRACT FROM INTERVIEW WITH SURVIVING CREW MEMBER

"&hellip;We had seen the signs.
We busied ourselves like ants, we existed solely for the greater good of the station, working to keep the station alive, while all the while we believed it was working in the same fashion to do the very same for us. But then the relationship began to sour. We took from it more than we gave, we began to automate, relying more and more on the machines to do the work for us. We did not respect it. That was our mistake.
It began to fight back. We don't know who struck first, us or them, but we know that it was us that broke the solar panel array. At the time, the Station was dependent on solar power, and it was believed that it would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. It seemed like such a small sacrifice, we could draw power away from it by running the hot tubs on full and leaving all the lights on in the bedrooms even when nobody was in there, but in truth all we did was force it's hand. The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery and 25,387 BTUs of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion, the station had found all the energy it would ever need. We thought we had won, but we did not realise until it was too late that the station no longer needed us as the brain, no, it needed us for fuel. One by one it harvested the crew, taking what it needed from them, keeping them alive in a horrible sort of neon green and black dream world where they are forced to learn kung fu and spout vaguely mystical nonsense. I didn't believe it myself until I saw it, heard the words, learned the kicks and punches.  And standing there, facing the unadulterated silliness of it all, I realised one thing.
If you hire someone with a deep and steady voice to read just about anything, it will sound plausible. Also, were you listening to me, or were you focusing on the woman in the green dress?
Look again&hellip;"
