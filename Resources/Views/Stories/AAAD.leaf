Lawlessness is not a new phenomenon.
Wherever the yoke of law chafes at the neck of the populace, criminal elements will make themselves known. At first through small infractions and minor misdeeds, but soon this behaviour will spread, worsen, until anarchy reigns and society nears collapse.
The Admiral had to do something, they knew it, before the station was forever lost to criminal scum. Law abiding citizens feared to walk the corridors; the turbo-lifts had been vandalised so heavily that not a single one aboard the station worked and gangs of armed thugs roamed from module to module, stealing and vandalising and wearing dirt into all the carpets.
Truly a nightmare for all.
In desperation, the Admiral agreed to a radical plan: A terminally injured officer, Roberts, gunned down in the line of duty would be rebuilt anew as a cyborg crime fighter. Matching the unbridled combat potential of an armour plated machine with the intuition and street smarts of one of the finest police officers they had ever seen, the military technologists on board the station worked tirelessly in their labs and transformed the shattered body of the cop into a gleaming avatar of untamed justice. Officer Roberts was reborn&hellip; as Robbo-Cop
It was a success. Soon, the chromed figure was seen striding purposefully through the station, barking commands, arresting malfeasants, cleaning up after himself. Criminals cowered from this new threat, their weapons proving useless against it's armoured might, those that refused to obey were executed.
Order returned. Now, the law abiding were once again able to walk their station unharmed, unafraid. Though this came with compromises. The new semi-mechanical figure tended to err a little strongly on the side of the law, with minor infractions carrying heavy penalties. More than one resident found themselves looking down the barrel of Robbo-Cop's gun or in handcuffs for such illegal behaviour as accidentally dropping litter or breaking wind in a lift.
Still, it was a small price to pay to banish crime from the station. As a side note to this, the wily Admiral sold off the merchandising rights to Robbo-Cop's likeness and began selling toys and t-shirts based on the now famous crime fighter. The best seller was a small keyring that looked like Robbo-Cop's iconic helmet and spoke some of his famous lines when you pressed the nose. 
You could buy that for a dollar.
