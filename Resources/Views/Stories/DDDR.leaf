The Admiral stood before the chalkboard that had been hastily rigged up amidst the clutter of HQ. Taking a moment to smooth their uniform, they continued pointing to the various lines, notes and skull and crossbones icons that dotted the map indicating paths to Probable, Likely and Certain Death.
It was a simple plan, one that involved very little in the way of tactics and rather a lot in the way of disposable manpower willing to lay down their lives for a cause they knew to be far larger and nobler than they could ever aspire to be. After all, within them they each carried the hearts of lions and the blood of the mightiest of their number. Who among them could forget the glorious sacrifice of Grand Admiral Motoko, who fell at the battle of the Darts Board. Who among them could not recall the valiant defence of the jukebox and the countless lives lost to keep it from falling into the hands of the enemy? The Admiral exhorted them to remember, to recall, and to aspire to die as heroes as so many before them had, pausing only to wipe a tear from one eye. There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
Except for one. One lone soldier who dared not to weep at the mention of such sacrifices. One lone soldier who dared speak when the Admiral was speaking. Everyone turned and stared. If there was one thing that was certain aboard this station it was that nobody, absolutely NOBODY, should ever try to interrupt the Admiral during a pre-battle inspirational speech.
Not only did they dare speak, but they also dared question the wisdom of the Admiral's plan. Rather than yet another all out assault where they charged across the No-man's land in front of the Ping Pong table, countless of their number dying along the way, could they not just use those men and women to build another recreation block instead? Maybe convert the armoury or training camp into a theatre?
Deathly silence. The kind of awful soundlessness that accompanies someone accidentally breaking wind in a lift.
All at once the Admiral's voice filled the room and the upstart crew member was hoisted unceremoniously by the armpits and chucked into an airlock, where they would be fired out into the cold hard vacuum of space.
The Admiral was visibly shaken. Mutiny it was, mutiny! Well they'd all see how right the plan was when they returned victorious, holding aloft their prize. Future generations would speak of this day as the deciding moment of the conflict, when the balance of fortune shifted decisively and the end of the war began to loom closer.
That day they captured the tiddlywinks set.
