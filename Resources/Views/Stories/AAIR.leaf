Space. What does the word conjure to the mind's eye? The infinite blackness, perhaps? The yawning chasm between stars, darkness incarnate, all consuming, terrifying nothingness?
Or perhaps the more mundane. Space to live. Space to breath. Personal space. Anyone who has ever had a long haul flight sat next to someone who doesn't understand that arm rests need to be shared or that your shoulder isn't a pillow rest dreams of space. Leg room. Room to stretch out. Glorious, uninhibited space.
The Admiral had been faced with a dilemma. The station, as it was, could not continue to function. There were simply too many of them, the population of the station had exploded, seemingly overnight, to the point where it was now pretty much standing room only. The Admiral no longer even had an Admiral's desk, surely one of the main perks of the job. Instead everyone had to stand facing in the same direction, and when you wanted to write something you took your pen out of the person in front of you's back pocket and used their back as a flat surface to write on. You slept standing up, ate standing up, and when you needed the bathroom everyone had to move in a slow, shuffling conga line to get the necessary person to the loo before they suffered an accident. And there were far too few bathrooms and far too many accidents.
It couldn't go on. The population was putting too much pressure on the already overstretched resources of the station. Everything had to be rationed. Water was down to a few sips a day, food was almost nonexistent, and you were only allowed breathe in once every five seconds when the Breath Alarm sounded.
Something had to be done, and so The Admiral took desperate measures.
Nobody questioned the funny little green crackers when they started showing up in the ration packs. Rumour was they were made from some kind of high protein algae that grew in the water purification tanks. They were a little salty, but otherwise perfectly palatable, and as they came in addition to the regular rations, there were no complaints. More food was always welcome.
Shortly after this, the Breath Alarm was shortened from five seconds to three. Then two. Then they got rid of it altogether. The station, as one, took a literal sigh of relief, just for the novelty of being able to do so.
A few weeks later, the first member of the station crew managed to sit down. People marvelled, word spread like wildfire of this amazing innovation. The audacity of it, the sheer modernity of the thinking behind this simple act. They didn't have to stand any more. Soon, everyone was sitting, and shortly after that lying down became the new hot craze all the kids were doing.
People noticed their friends didn't seem to be where they remembered them in line any more. Whispers around the station spoke of vanishings, of people who went into the factory module and didn't come out, but these were quickly dismissed as fanciful ghost stories. All that lying down was causing blood to rush to peoples heads, no wonder they were coming up with such outlandish notions. Better just to keep quiet, treat yourself to a little sit down and maybe have another of those plentiful green crackers&hellip;
