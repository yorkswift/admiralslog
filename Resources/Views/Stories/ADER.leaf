Planning is always the least fun element of anything. When was the last time anyone said "The thing I look forward to most when I'm heading off on my holidays is producing an exhaustive spreadsheet cataloguing every single little thing I need to pack, from pants to portable defibrillators, with a checklist and a colour coded table of their importance to the success of the whole endeavour?"
The answer is almost never. And the people who do say things like that are probably the kind of people you actually should cross the street to avoid, lest they try and aggressively reorganise you and your personal effects.
The unfortunate fact to consider, however, is that in a spinning space station floating at a stationary point amidst the vast, capriciously cruel and constantly surprising expanse of a Lagrange Point&hellip; such people are really, really useful. In an environment when the smallest thing like a missing rivet or a pinprick sized hole can cause disaster, having somebody who colour codes their socks is often better than someone who calls themselves DonkeyGame BombsAway and is simultaneously a particle physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, martial artist and rock star. Everybody knows which they'd like to get stuck in a lift with, but that person is unlikely to know what the best layout for a sewer system is.
Therefore, with a lack of such people to plan, measure, maintain and otherwise serve as the infrastructure backbone of a station, the result is inevitable. While they have everything they need by way of schools, soldiers, beds and tetherball sets, the reality is far more grave. Nobody remembers to schedule exams or draft lesson plans. Nobody remembers to order boot polish or check the atmospheric filters. Nobody remembers to check the water supply levels, and nobody can ever find the ping pong ball.
Such a society cannot exist for long, in a state of utter disorganised chaos. It will only be a matter of time before someone forgets to check the airlock seals or whether the TryFrithium crystals can actually take it and the whole ship turns inside out, blows up or, worst of all, runs out of teabags.
