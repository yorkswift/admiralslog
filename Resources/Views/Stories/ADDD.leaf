In the days of Feudal Japan, there existed a particular kind of warrior known as the Samurai. Proud, noble and stalwart in their adherence to tradition, the samurai lived in service of their master with unflinching loyalty.
But, there existed another class of samurai. Those who had no master whom they could devote themselves to. These were known as the Ronin, the wanderers, those who were cursed to walk their world on the whim of fate, finding work or trouble as they went. Swords for hire, they popularised folklore and storytelling for centuries.
The Admiral of this particular station had a similar problem. They had poured so much time, energy and resource into the construction of a fierce, tactically agile and supremely loyal fighting force that they hadn't, in their singular vision, thought of where these soldiers might live. The station was effectively split into two very distinct camps: Those with a bed, and those without. Those without would sleep where they could, finding comfort under a desk, in a doorway or in the break room cupboards. It was quite unnerving to find a heavily armed soldier taking a short nap in the cupboard where you expected a chocolate biscuit or two to be kept.
Worse than this, however, were those lucky enough to have a bed. As currency fell into disuse, the economy of the station became entirely dependant on napping. Those who owned beds became immensely powerful: By promising allowed nap times to the wandering, bed-less soldiers, they could effectively buy their fealty. Soon, feudal armies begin to arise among the crew, tiny prefectures localised around a single bunk room or bed, fierce and individual and willing to die in the name of memory foam mattress toppers. Skirmishes were common, many lives were lost over who got to flip the pillow and enjoy the cool side.
Faced with the mounting pressure of an inchoate feudal state, the Admiral had no choice but to join in with this duvet based caste system. In their wisdom, however, they had packed a selection of fuzzy slippers and an eye mask which they had pilfered from the in flight comfort pack on the way to the station, these exotic luxuries proved enough of a draw to bring many of the stations wandering soldiers to the Admiral's fledgling empire. Their army grew, and as it did so it began to subsume the beds around the Admiral's, seizing through bloody violence two double beds and a fold out sofa bed. Once this haul had been amassed, others quickly bowed to the Admiral, who wore a small neck pillow atop their head as a kind of crown and a fleece blanket around their shoulders as a robe. Order was restored, and soon all beds were united in this new empire under the Admiral's watchful eye.
And so, into legend, strode the First Emperor of Comfort.
