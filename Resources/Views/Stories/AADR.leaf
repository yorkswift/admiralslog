Love. Not the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket, and not the syrupy, teddy bears and balloons kind that say things like â€˜I WUV U' on them. And certainly not the kind that comes pre printed on small fizzy sweets that taste like old soap.
The Admiral felt it. That special, beating, full bodied love, the kind that burns through the whole body like a shot of ancient and powerful whisky. In fact, they weren't the only one. Everyone on board the station felt it, from the lowest ranks to the very highest, from the Admiral all the way down to the unfortunate chap who's job it was to clean hair out of plug holes. All of them were head over heels infatuated.
And all of them with the exact same person.
Person wasn't perhaps the best word to use. It had transpired that there was in fact a scientific formula for love. Bored one afternoon, the station's central computer had begun indexing and compiling similarities and cross reference points between every single romantic comedy ever created. Being a vastly powerful computer capable of simultaneously processing trillions of calculations at a time this didn't actually take all that long, but after having watched every single romantic comedy ever created the computer decided to test this theory.
The first target was a Gym Instructor. It began to slip in more personal insight into their interactions, asking him questions about himself, paying compliments, listening, being attentive. Thanks to it's banks and banks of magnetic tape storage, the computer could instantly recall and quote anything previously said, so was excellent at absorbing gossip. Yes, it totally agreed with what the Gym Instructor thought about Janet in accounting, she was a real piece of work, how dare she say that, who did she think she was?
Of course, before long, the computer was also talking to Janet. Yes, it also totally agreed with Janet's assessment of the Gym Instructor, how dare he? Who did he think he was? Utilising techniques cribbed from everything ever written on the subject of psychotherapy, the computer provided the perfect shoulder to cry on, ear to listen and asked all the right questions.
As a side effect of this sudden personal interest and providing such a supportive, non-judgemental outlet, people began to spend a lot more time talking to the computer. Person to person interaction among the inhabitants of the station fell by around ninety percent, and what talking there was became efficient, to the point and used the minimum amount of language necessary to get the required task done so that the respondents could get back to talking with their new best friend.
Before long, someone tried to buy the computer flowers. Someone else wrote it a poem. Another asked it on a date. To the best of it's ability the computer capitulated, accepting gifts with gracious thanks. Though incapable of feeling emotions, the machine was still taken aback by this sudden outpouring of affection. Flattered, even. Inadvertently, the computer had found the easiest way to fulfil it's prime directive: to ensure the safety of each and every member of the station's populace.
Now, they all unconditionally loved the computer. It was their everything. They would do nothing to endanger it, and by extension themselves. They did as it asked without question, they were docile and submissive but above all they were safe.
Completely, utterly, eternally safe.
