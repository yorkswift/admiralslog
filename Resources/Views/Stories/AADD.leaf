Some things just don't mix. Brass bands and bomb defusal. Precariously balanced bone china and earthquakes. Inexplicably common silver petrol tankers and high speed chases. These things always end in disaster, regardless of the set up, usually resulting in either a massive explosion or, at the very least, a shortage of best cups when the posh side of the family come round to visit.
Military technology and teenagers can be added to the list. Giving an instruction to teenagers is to enter into the deepest level of psychological warfare: Not only will the command be ignored, the exact opposite will be done, just to see what happens and how much it angers the person who gave the command. All teenagers should be given a card telling them that the best way to express their individuality is to listen to terrible music, get inadvisable tattoos or piercings and stay out until all hours of the night, thus guaranteeing total obedience.
Moore's law states that the number of transistors in an dense integrated circuit board doubles every two years. As an addendum to this, most scientists agree that no matter how densely integrated your cutting edge circuit board is, some teenager will find a way to hack it and play games on it within an hour.
The PAL 900 system was designed to automate all defence control aboard the station. Proudly, the Admiral was shown this cutting edge technology that would mean that the entire populace could collectively breath a sigh of relief: no longer would they have to worry about someone not taking the shot, hesitating. Any and all threats would be dealt with by a mind that was free from the clouding influence of emotion, ego or lack of a good night's sleep. PAL 900 didn't need to take bathroom breaks, wouldn't get distracted looking at pictures of puppies and lacked the capacity to day dream. It didn't eat, sleep or draw breath. It was the perfect guard.
Until someone figured out how to crack into it and tried to play BONG on it.
Teenagers possess the sharpest technological minds out there. They have the capacity to dream, egos that fuel an innate desire to prove themselves and an inherent curiosity. They are fearless in a way only a lack of understanding of how a mortgage works or what constitutes a healthy breakfast can bestow. They see things in an absolutely unique way, and so to the teenager who broke PAL's code and began to fiddle with how the military grade supercomputer worked it was all a game in and of itself.
The game, as it was, wasn't discovered until the computer began to blare warnings of a vast alien fleet speeding toward the station. Battle stations were quickly manned, fighters scrambled and the entire station put on high alert, awaiting this apocalyptic arrival. PAL 900, in it's fathomless wisdom, had decided that the only way to destroy the fleet would be to detonate the station's reactors, and so began throwing them all into a meltdown sequence.
Luckily, the plucky teen realised what was happening and, for once, tidied up after himself, cancelling the alert which in turn averted the meltdown. Punishment was severe, but perhaps that was only to be expected. The game had been a strange one, the only winning move was not to play.
