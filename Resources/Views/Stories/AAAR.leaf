An infection is what occurs when a disease carrying agent invades an organism and begins to overtake it's system. Often, such insidious contagions are carried by a foreign body entering the environment, whether that be through accident&hellip; or design.
They had put their very best minds on it, and the Admiral had agreed that a Space Elevator was an excellent idea. Instead of wasting all that fuel flying rockets too and from the station to ferry supplies, why not just build a lift? Given the unique gravitational situation and totally stationary nature of the station in the Lagrange point, it would be an absolute cinch to build, like drawing a line between two points. They could start at the ground and work up, and then they could have a round the clock easy way to move things back and forth between planetary colonies and the station. People, machine parts, food, water, extra VHS tapes, a world of possibilities would be open to them, and so they built it. A great glittering glass tube that connected the station to the world beneath, an artery of trade and commerce.
What they were not expecting, however, was a small straw donkey with a colourful shirt and hat on.
It arrived, without pomp or ceremony, amongst a shipment of astromech components and the usual trickle of tourists who wanted to come and see what life was like aboard a real space station. Normally these people got bored after a few days wandering the corridors and bemoaning the lack of waterparks and left, but this group was&hellip; different.
They had a donkey with them. It wasn't big or even alive, possessing a pair of large googly eyes that made it look slightly, well, it had a certain cute charm about it. Nobody knew who it belonged to or what it was doing with them when they exited the elevator and boarded the station, and it was left in the lost and found bin beside the elevator embarkation airlock.
Soon, there were more. More donkeys, of different sizes and shapes and colours. All with googly eyes that seemed to follow the viewer around the room. Then there were comedy sombreros with slogans on like "Kiss me Quick, Engage the Thrusters" and "I Don't Find Puns about Re-entry Funny". Again, these were all discarded into the now overflowing lost and found bin.
Then, the unthinkable happened. People started seeing the pile of donkeys, oversized hats, brightly coloured t-shirts and cheap sunglasses as an opportunity to take a souvenir. People began wearing the things they found in the bin, proudly wandering the station clutching a donkey, wearing flip flops and sarongs and sipping cocktails. Drunkenness abounded, fuelled in part by the discovery that the astromech components they kept receiving were actually novelty drinking glasses.
It was all over before the Admiral even realised it had happened. The rot spread with the inexorable, awful pull of a black hole, swallowing up the station almost overnight. Before they knew it there was a waterpark, a lot of themed sports bars pretending to be Irish and lots of sunburnt people wearing too little and drinking far too much. Children ran around unattended, there was a terrible nightclub that played the same awful bass heavy thumping and coach loads of club 18-30 holidaymakers arriving on the Space Elevator.
And every single one of them was carrying a googly eyed straw donkey.
