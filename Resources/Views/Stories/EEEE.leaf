Having ploughed all available time, space and budget into education, their station had progressed beyond what the textbooks could teach them. After they had conquered such universal mysteries of trigonometry, cookery and correct apostrophe usage other, more exotic experiments began. At first these were relatively benign things like trying to teach children to crush coke cans with their minds without getting a nosebleed, or how to fold hotel towels so that they looked like swans. As their knowledge grew, so too did their discoveries, until they stumbled on this place.
They had found what was beyond our own plane of existence.
They had found&hellip; The Inverted.
It was dark, the Admiral found, though they had no trouble seeing everything around them was black. The floor seemed to be covered in a thin layer of liquid, and it was very quiet. They had tried doing several deeply scientific things, like adjusting the pens in the pocket of their lab coat and thinking of all their favourite numbers, but nothing had really happened.
There was nothing there, except THE VOICE
The Admiral asked it where exactly they had ended up, and THE VOICE answered. They were in a between place. They were nowhere, but still somewhere. They were in the cracks between the worlds, and there were so very many of them.
The Admiral asked to see these worlds, THE VOICE obliged. The blackness dissolved to show a vision of Earth, that planet that the Admiral had left behind so long ago, now all it's lands divided into coloured regions which towering shiny figures in bright, primary hues fought over. Some on horseback, some manning great artillery guns, all the same Day-Glo brilliant shades.
Another vision. They were in a city now, pursued by a moustachioed man, a small terrier and an old shoe that seemed intent on charging them money for staying in one of their attractive and well placed bright red hotels. Another vision and another. Vast serpents rearing up to snatch at them as they ascended ladders. A shadowy country manor in which potential murderers lurked clutching candlesticks and pieces of lead pipe that they had found in the library or perhaps the billiards room.
THE VOICE span these worlds passed the Admiral like a zoetrope, the myriad possibilities blurring and bleeding into one another. All the while it whispered that together, they would rule them all.
