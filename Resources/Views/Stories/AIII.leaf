For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost&hellip;

Revolution often begins from the smallest and most insignificant of sparks. The event that began the uprising that would eventually topple the station started from something so minor that it beggars belief: 
The banning of socks.
Perhaps a little context is needed. The station, as it was, was in desperate need of power. A station can only exist in a Lagrange Point through the gravitational interference of multiple celestial bodies, and in this case one of them happened to be a sun. Boundless, effervescent fusion giving off abundant energy, but how to harness it? The answer, and what the station[s crew sought to build was a Dyson Sphere: A massive structure that would completely encircle the star, absorbing all of it's energy and promising to provide unlimited free energy for as long as the celestial body within continued to burn. Such a massive, dangerous and highly theoretical undertaking necessitated a workforce of incredibly dedicated and driven individuals&hellip; who, as it happened, enjoyed a spot of tennis.
With no recreation module to unwind in, the workers of the station had taken it upon themselves to create their own fun and games. Illicit games of chess were painstakingly whittled from offcuts of scrap metal and little odds and ends with surreptitiously acquired rock hammers. Noughts and Crosses boards were etched into most metal surfaces, but favourite amongst the games was Tennis. By using two frying pans and rolling up a couple of socks into a makeshift ball, hours of fun could be had batting it back and forth across a bunk room. The crowd would cheer, the umpire nodding and gesticulating as the ball bounced over one of the imaginary court lines. One of the players throwing his pan/racket down in disgust and screaming that the umpire couldn't possibly be serious.
Then the Admiral found out. Rather than do the logical thing and recognise the frustrations of the crew, they instead took the ludicrous step of banning socks. Working so close to a Sun all day meant that the workers were constantly bathed in sweat, and due to their lack of socks their shoes became uncomfortable and rubbed something dreadful.
The discomfort could only go on for so long. Eventually, tired of their boredom, mistreatment and sweaty feet, the workers overthrew the Admiral in a vicious conflagration of revolutionary violence and claimed the station for themselves. A cautionary tale for any would be Admirals out there&hellip; Never underestimate people's love for socks.
