Some services are so well known that they need no advertising. Everyone knows that dialling a certain three digit number on your telephone will quickly summon a member of the emergency services, and also (but slightly more inexplicably) nobody has ever seen an advertisement for a Chinese Restaurant.
Everybody knows who they're gonna call if they have a problem with ghosts, goblins and ghouls, or if there's something strange in your neighbourhood. But what if the said menace doesn't belong to the undead, isn't an awoken restless spirit and doesn't care if you cross the beams or not? What if the thing you're scared of, or having trouble with, is instead an Alien?
Luckily enough there is another service available for stations at Lagrange Points. Men and women tasked with being the first, last and only line of defence against menaces and disturbances of an extra terrestrial nature, even if technically everyone living at Lagrange Points is an Extra Terrestrial. They're here to help, not argue semantics.
They arrive without fanfare or explanation. One moment there's a multi-limbed, extra dimensional terror threatening to smash up a food court, next there's just them. Those men and women in their sharply tailored green suits, toting bizarre gadgets and outlandish chromed weaponry.
It is whispered that perhaps they are aliens themselves, trying not to ruin it for everyone by allowing the actions of a few individuals to threaten a galactic war. Some say they are from a parallel universe, a different plane of existence where they watch over the Lagrange Points for unknown reasons.
It would surprise everyone to learn that none of these assertions are true. They are, in fact, just as human as everyone else is. They even have a Space Station among the others, albeit one kitted out with advanced technology and styled in a strange, futuristic fashion.
As for their Admiral? Not such a mystery, merely someone who saw a gap in the market and decided to fill it with sharply suited, mysterious agents of a shadowy pseudo-government branch. Call it philanthropy, call it mystery, but as long as they continue their work, the denizens of all Lagrange Points can sleep easy, knowing that these green-suited figures watch over them, saving them from annihilation in ways they will never know and never hope to understand.
