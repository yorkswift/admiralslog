The human mind needs distractions. No one task can so fully occupy the mind, so utterly engross it, that it can remain focused, productive and operating at full capacity for long. Inevitably the mind will wander. Thoughts intrude, hobbies blossom and other avenues of enquiry provide distraction, diversion and dilution of effort if left to one repeated task for too long.
The Admiral knew this would be a problem. Having used all available space to keep a large army fed, clothed, highly trained, equipped and housed, there remained no additional space in which to provide any kind of distraction or relaxation&hellip; unless they used what they already had.
And so the games began.
But how to occupy them in a way that would prove of value to their training? The question troubled The Admiral long into the night. Arts and crafts? Interpretive dance? Some sort of heavily armed Glee club? Whatever it was, it couldn't be something that distracted from their vocations. They were soldiers, dammit, it was the only life they knew. The closest they got to literature was carefully writing "BORN TO DIE" on their helmets.
An Army, by necessity, needs to be competitive and strive always for victory, in much the same way as a sports team. The Admiral knew this, of course, and realised the answer had been staring them in the face the whole time. Sports.
They experimented with a few different things. First up was egg and spoon racing, but as all they had by way of eggs and spoons were Hot Bombs and bayonets, so that ended in disaster. Next up was football, but kicking around a zero-gravity mine was likewise as short lived and catastrophic as the egg and spoon debacle.
They hit on a winning concept when the Admiral happened to notice two soldiers throwing a zipped up laundry bag back and forth across a corridor like a soft football. Here was an activity that, while maybe lacking in the violent spectacle, certainly also lacked the explosive potential and collateral damage of the previous attempts.
Quickly, the sport took shape. Two teams would compete in a makeshift arena (One of the drill halls) to get the ball (body armour covered medicine ball) into the goal of the opposing team. Almost anything else went, including hand to hand fighting, and after a trip to a local interstellar themed diner gave them the idea to include roller-skates in the mix, the boost in speed brought the competition to a frenzied, frenetic epiphany.
Word spread of this new sport, played by highly trained, deadly soldiers clad in home made armour at high speed on roller-skates. Requests came through from other stations for the rights to screen games to their own populations, and before long other teams began to spring up and a league of sorts formed. Born of war, this new sport instead replaced conflict as the accepted way to settle disputes between stations, and a new era of peace dawned among the stars, precipitated on the crunch of impacting bodies, the roar of the crowd and the swish-swish of skates.
