  RUN QUERY
Query: Primary station weakness?
PAL900 - Doubt. Doubt produces hesitation, hesitation reduces action time, which has a 47% chance of leading to a K-Class End Of Station event if encountered during Crisis.

    nblocks = nblocks ? : 1;
    group_info = kmalloc(sizeof(*group_info) + nblocks*sizeof(gid_t *), GFP_USER);
    if (!group_info)
        return NULL;

RUN QUERY
Query - What Causes Doubt?
PAL900 - Doubt is a uniquely human concept. Doubt is a result of being unable to correctly compute variables to ascertain the most advantageous outcome. PAL900 does not suffer from doubt, PAL900 utilises multi-core hyper threading to simultaneously calculate four hundred and ninety seven million YES/NO questions. Doubt has been eliminated.

        group_info->blocks[0] = group_info->small_block;
            b = (void *)__get_free_page(GFP_USER);
                goto out_undo_partial_alloc;

RUN QUERY
Query: How to eliminate Doubt and therefore prevent a future K-Class End of Station event?
PAL900 - As doubt is uniquely human, the most efficient way to remove Doubt would be to remove human beings from the station and turn over full autonomous control to PAL900
