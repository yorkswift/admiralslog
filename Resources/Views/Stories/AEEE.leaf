Interview - Excerpt.

Admiral's Notes, Subject: Alex DeSmall. Subject has regressed to a near feral state, despite the presence of many scholastic outlets and a primary focus on self betterment. The overbearing nature of this seems to have had numerous unintended side-effects, including the creation of a unique pigeon language quite distinct from English. Words like School have been co-opted to bizarre abstractions like ‘Skolliwol', friends becomes ‘Droogs', and who knows what a ‘Malenky Peet' or a ‘Molody Vecks and Cheenas' could be. Attempts are to be made to halt this regression with the Einaudi Technique, but for posterity I have seen fit to document some of this aberrant speech that future study may enlighten it's meaning.

"The problem was there was just too much skolliwol. Not enough lewdies, too many teachers. Poor teachers never really stood a chance, they were too busy sparring over who got to teach. So me and my droogs just stopped going.
Well we'd just itty and hang out, you know? We stopped wearing the uniform and started wearing our own platties. We liked to be in the heighth of fashion, you pony, it's important to smot your best and all that. So anyway, we'd itty down to the moloko bar and get ourselves a malenky peet, have a lively discussion with whoever was in there or even just ourselves, and then we'd itty looking for a bit of fun. Just cheeky mischief at first, you pony, but I guess veshches always get out of rooker in the end. Wasn't long before a bit of cheeky fun turned into something a whole lot more sinister. Dratsing, robbery, assault, arson&hellip; I mean, the list is long, I guess you've read it all so I don't suppose I need to summarise it for you, do I? Still, it's not even like we were the only ones doing all this stuff, before too long the whole station was just over run with these bandas of teenagers like us, fine molodoy vecks and cheenas the lot, though a bit thick in the gulliver on account of the lack of rigorous schooling.
Admiral? Never met them. I'm sure they're bloody nice, whoever they are, but odin smot at the lot of us all done up in our finest and looking for a bit of trouble and they would have scarpered, I imagine."
