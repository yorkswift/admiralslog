There is a old truism that one should never bring a knife to a gun fight. The general thought behind this is that it pays to be better armed and prepared than one's opponents, though does not account for the need, after any good gunfight, to slice lemons for a round of celebratory Gin and Tonics to toast the fact that you are still alive. Perhaps the phrase should be modified to read never bring ONLY a knife to a gun fight, but still the spirit of it remains: The most well armed opponent wins.
Ignoring such famous contradictions to this as the Vietnam War, the Admiral of this particular station began a program of development in which all available resources were thrown into the development of IT. The gun to end all guns. The gun that made all others look like primitive knives. The Ultimate Weapon, though not one featuring moustachioed wrestlers who call everyone Brother.
There were breakthroughs and there were setbacks. Tractor Beams were an early avenue of exploration, though they remained only useful for moving TV remotes into one's hand to avoid having to get up off the sofa. Wormholes came into play, but never got beyond the utility of opening a window into what was in the fridge so that, once again, the need to get up off the sofa was eliminated.
Soon after these proved dead ends, the Admiral had the stunning idea of installing fridges and remotes into the arms of all sofas aboard the station, thus eliminating the need to research ways to avoid having to get up during reruns of Space Cops, and progress after this point was rapid.
Finally, they cracked it.
It started as a mechanism for opening tinned foods when you can't find the can opener. A single laser, generated by passing light through a crystal prism, focused through a refining lens, charged with a dish array. It failed utterly in it's original stated aim of opening a tin when it was test fired and opened a hole clear through the side of the station, nearly causing the deaths of every single person on board. Further prototypes were relegated to outside testing, and once mounted on the outer hull, the huge grey dish array was a fearsome sight indeed. A weapon unlike any previously seen, more terrifying, more potent, more destructive than anything that came before it. Finally, their battle station was fully operational.
So they wait, now, a menacing shape against the blackness of space, a shark amongst the minnows of the Lagrange Points, searching for a proverbial knife fight to bring this gun to.
