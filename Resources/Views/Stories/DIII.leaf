During wars, soldiers have been known to enter battle under music. This tradition probably started as a way to make sure everyone walked at the same speed. Other unintended benefits included not tripping over other peoples feet and everyone arriving at the same time. With it's inherent similarity to warfare, anyone who's played five a side football knows it's important that everyone's there at the right time, though if the five a siders have brought bayonets this can prove problematic.
Over time, however, this behaviour evolved. It became a great way to make sure all the soldiers marched in step, thus preventing people from accidentally tripping over their muskets. Then, it became a cool looking way to trick out your army helicopter: by strapping huge speakers all over it and blasting guitar solos out.
Fast forwarding to the Lagrange Points, imagine the terrible fear of a beleaguered, disaster struck station as they see a fleet of military spacecraft bearing down on them. Of course, being space there would be no way for them to blast music at people through the airless environment, but they'd have someone flashing the lyrics on cards in the windows, which is perhaps even more terrifying.
Then, imagine their fear turning to surprise, then wonder, then delight, when it turned out the soldiers weren't there to ransack their base, steal all their cake and fire lasers at everything. When the soldiers did things like put up schools, rescue people, put out fires, and make sure people were safe, secure, and didn't have to be afraid.
People asked the Admiral why? With such an elite fighting force of highly trained, disciplined and heavily armed troops, what was stopping them waging war on and ultimately conquering the Lagrange points?
The answer took everyone by surprise.
"We tried war. Turns out it's really, really dangerous. It looks really cool when you see it in movies with all the explosions and the muscles and the tanks and stuff, but it's actually really loud and everything's dirty and people get hurt, sometimes very badly. We don't want to do that, imagine if someone turned up at your door and wanted to hurt you? They wouldn't be a very nice person, would they? We like being nice people, helping people, it makes us feel good inside in a way no slow motion footage of a bunker exploding or guns shooting ever could. Besides, that's why we left Earth in the first place. Too much fighting and too many people who think guns are a good idea. Out here, among the stars, we can be whoever we want to be, we can do whatever we want to do, and we'd like to think that if we're kind enough to other people and stop expecting the worst in everyone, maybe they'll pay it forward and do the same."
The Admiral was right. It turns out peace will always win out in the end, and faced with the overwhelming positivity and love they shared, the Lagrange Points became a much better, safer and quieter place to live than Earth ever had been.
