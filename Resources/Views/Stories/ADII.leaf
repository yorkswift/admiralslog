No-one would have believed, in the last years of the twentieth century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space. No-one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinised, as someone who eats burnt toast in bed must invariably look for crumbs. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets, and yet here they were, floating at the fixed Lagrange Point, both pioneering and terribly vulnerable. Across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to theirs regarded these space stations with envious eyes, and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against them&hellip;
One cannot, surely, underestimate the importance of rigorous planning. Faced with such incalculable menace as these malevolent beings from other worlds, a stalwart defence was mounted. Man would not sit idly by and allow such crimes, and neither would woman allow man to take all the credit by using the masculine pronoun to refer to all. A defence rightly encompassing both genders and all orientations was begun.
Station after station fell to the insidious foe: their weapons were vastly superior to those on offer to the denizens of the stations. Heat rays that could not only disintegrate a human body in a matter of seconds with a high pitched keening note, but could heat a plastic wrapped pre-cooked dinner to edible temperature in a few minutes, provided one pierced the film lid beforehand.
The Admiral saw this threat, and galvanised the crew to it. Hurriedly, they press-ganged the modules of the station into military purpose.
Once the invaders arrived on their towering, terrifying tripods, they were unprepared for the true scale of human willingness to not get cooked alive in their clothes.
The fight was short, bloody, but ultimately victorious. Swords have, in the past, been fashioned into ploughshares in times of peace, but now was not the time for peace. Now was the time for beating an Alien's head in with a length of lead pipe or an adjustable three eights socket wrench.
Watching, awed by the spectacle, it became clear to the Admiral that one thing was for certain: as long as they could stop for a cup of tea every half an hour, they weren't carpenters. Or potters, sculptors or blacksmiths. They were an army, Hoo Rah, and a terrifying one at that.
