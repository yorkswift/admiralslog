It was quite the most prestigious private school ever constructed.
The Admiral had always harboured secret dreams about a never-spent childhood at a whimsical boarding school. Such fun, through rose coloured glasses gifted to those with absolutely no grasp of what such schools are like. The never ending, almost penal like existence in some crumbling facility staffed by relics masquerading as teachers. Most don't even teach children how to do magic, just talk in a ridiculously plumy fashion and pursue a career in finance.
Still, buoyed with enthusiasm and a love of such idealogical propaganda as the Fabulous Five and Skullduggerous Seven books, the Admiral built what can only be described as the most authentic boarding school experience possible&hellip; in space. Wood panelling everywhere. Horsehair stuffed armchairs. Log fires, leather bound books, paintings of stern looking old men with white hair tufting out of their ears and a liberal caning for any and all infractions. What fun!
The one problem the Admiral had with boarding school was that there would always be those few children they had to let in from disadvantaged backgrounds. The sort who had incredible athletic ability, prodigiously powerful minds and a devilish cunning their silver-spoon teethed cohorts did not possess. Such children, the Admiral felt, always spoiled it for the rest of them. They lowered the respectability of the place. Coming from inferior breeding with nothing but their wits and tenacity meant their triumphs made a mockery of the genteel, bourgeois classes. And that simply wouldn't do. So they were banned. It became the first and only Public School in the history of Academia to admit purely on the rigours of family wealth rather than any form of scholastic grading. Indeed, proudly over the front door to the school house it proclaimed OMNEM PECUNIAM
They were taught all of the important military curricular that would ensure them every success in the cutthroat environs of deep space survival: Latin, History of Art, Ancient Greek Poetry, Fencing and, of course, Gentlemen's Boxing. To the Admiral, this was precisely the kind of robust syllabus that always helped the heroes of their childhood reading triumph over any adversary. Graduates were given elaborate scrolls proclaiming their qualification and certification to be resolute captains of industry and admirals in their own right. They then set off into the great void of the cosmos to seek fame and further fortune, each with an ego the size of a neutron star and a head full of delusions of self grandeur.
Of course, this was not the roaring success they had all hoped. Aggressive aliens, space pirates, undiscovered tribes on undiscovered planets and other astral nightmares do not understand what Queensbury Rules boxing is. They don't know how to fence, which direction to pass the port and certainly don't know what order to use their cutlery in at a formal luncheon. They do, however, know how to do things like vaporise people and smear them across the stars, or remove all of their innards without breaking the skin so that they can wear the pelt like a Theme Park Mascot.
Not to worry though, the Admiral thought as yet another reunion dinner was cancelled for lack of attendance. There's always next years children.
