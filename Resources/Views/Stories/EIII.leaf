Some people think that the most powerful of all human emotions is Love, but there is another, even more important emotion.
Boredom.
Boredom is what leads the sculptor to first pick up the chisel, or the painter the brush. Boredom is what causes a woman on a train to allow her mind to wander, and subsequently dream up a pantheon of child wizards attending a magical school. Boredom leads to curiosity as the mind attempts to occupy itself, and when it does the results can be fascinating&hellip; or truly terrible.
Aboard this particular station, there were really only two things one could do: Learn about sewers, pipes and air ducts, or busy oneself with the installation of sewers, pipes and air ducts.  The curriculum on such subjects is understandably brief, generations of school children have begged the answer to the question "How do you go to the loo in space?" Only to discover that the answer actually isn't all that interesting. Especially once the Centripetal Lavatory was invented, utilising it's own form of localised gravity through an eccentric high speed rotation to safely whisk the waste away.
Faced with an eternity of sewers, pipes and air-ducts, understandably the minds of those who concerned themselves with such things would wander. It is a curious phenomenon only spoken of briefly in the academy of sewers, pipes and air ducts that, if one spends enough time inside sewers, pipes and air-ducts, one may begin to hear voices. Far off shuffles and clatters amongst the network of arteries can be transformed by the distance and resonant quality of the construction materials into noises that can sound uncannily like speech, and new recruits were warned to not pay attention to these maddening sounds. However, such warnings fell on deaf ears, or at least ears that, instead of heeding the instructions, were instead preoccupied with the voices in the walls.
Before anyone knew what had happened it was already too late. They hadn't noticed the lone plumber talking to himself, sometimes hastily scribbling what looked like runes in the margins of his layout and plan diagrams. In fact quite the opposite, praise was heaped upon him for the elegance of the welding work he accomplished in the construction of a new fresh water recirculation system he was tasked with installing. People just chose not to notice the arcane symbols that had also been burned into some of the pipes.
The realisation only came when they tried to turn the recirculation system on. The plumber hadn't followed the plan given to him. No, instead of following the layout given to him, he had chosen one based on what the voices inside the pipes had told him, whispered to him, dripped into his ears like poison from a thread. Nobody noticed that he had, in fact, turned the fresh water recirculation system into a single giant pentagram that encompassed the entire station.
The wards glowed with malevolent dark light. Outside the station, a dark shape, huge against the flickering light of the stars, moved. Colossal wings blacked out the light, lurid green tendrils whipping from an unseen, maddening face. The Thing Between The Stars had come, summoned by the fresh water recirculation system.
And, in the blink of an eye, the station was gone.
