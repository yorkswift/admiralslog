Ever had one of those days when it feels like there just needs to be three of you to get everything you need to get done, done? This is the life of an Admiral of a Space Station floating amidst the Lagrange Points. You may think you're ahead of things, but there's always something waiting to creep up on you and just ruin your whole day. Fixed the soft serve ice cream machine? Well that's great, but the flamethrowers are all out of fuel. Unclogged the lint filters in the tumble dryers? Well done and all, but the Science block has accidentally unleashed a zombie plague. Fixed that leaky pipe in the service corridor? Grand work, but now some idiot in a blue police box has appeared out of nowhere and his multicoloured scarf is stuck in a revolving door.
Typical, every day examples of the life of a Station Admiral. Bouncing from crisis to crisis. In fact, the motto of Admiral's everywhere should be "When you do a job well, nobody notices. Screw up though, and everyone's suddenly an expert."
Eventually it all just got too much. However, rather than take a walk out of an airlock with no suit on or see what a laser rifle tastes like the Admiral decided quitting wasn't the answer. No, if people needed more of them than they were able to give, there would just have to be more of them.
They halted research on the experimental food replicators (though everyone would mourn the ability to say "Cup of Tea" and have one instantly to hand) and tried it on a new subject. The Admiral.
Soon, terminals were installed all throughout the station, and they were listening. As soon as someone said something like "I wish The Admiral would fix this lump in the carpet" the terminal nearest them would hum to life and in seconds there would be a life sized, living, breathing, fully articulate replica of The Admiral there to perform said menial task like fixing the lump in the carpet, which in that case turned out to be an old stale biscuit. Simple. Efficient. Effective.
But, of course, you can have too much of good thing.
They called them Replican-dos, and they spread. People couldn't get enough of them. Nobody much thought about the effect it would have on the station or what the ramifications of this rampant copying would be. Replican-dos didn't have an inbuilt expiry date on them, which meant they didn't become vicious predators desiring a scrap more life or go off on monologues about attack ships on fire on the shoulder of Orion. No, they just hung about, clogging up the place. Asking for The Admiral to do something didn't make one of the existing Replican-dos do it, it just summoned up another, and a kind of ghetto of counterfeit Admirals sprang up and began to engulf the station. More and more and more and more of them, until finally there was nowhere left. The Replican-dos so utterly outnumbered the crew of the Station that they had to abandon it, where it floats now, lost in the darkness of the Lagrange Point. Lost, like tears in rain.
